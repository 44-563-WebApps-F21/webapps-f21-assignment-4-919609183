        <h6 class=" ALLONBY name"> ALLONBY </h6> <p class=" ALLONBY speech"> What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a little!</p> 

        <h6 class="LADY name">LADY STUTFIELD</h6> <p class="lady speech"> Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?</p>

        <h6 class=" ALLONBY name"> ALLONBY </h6> <p class="ALLONBY speech"> Persecute us?  I wish they did.</p> 

        <h6 class="LADY name">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6><p class="LADY speech"> My dear!</p>

        <h6 class=" ALLONBY name"> ALLONBY </h6><p class="ALLONBY speech">  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be absolutely worn to shadows.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter Servants with coffee_.]</p>
        <h6 class="LADY name">LADY STUTFIELD</h6><p class="LADY speech"> Worn to shadows, dear?</p>

        <h6 class=" ALLONBY name"> ALLONBY </h6> <p class="ALLONBY speech"> Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.</p>

        <h6 class="LADY name">LADY STUTFIELD</h6><p class="LADY speech"> It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their power and use it.</p>
            <p class="stage-direction">[_Takes coffee from Servant_.]</p>
        <h6 class="LADY name">LADY CAROLINE</h6><p class="LADY speech"> What stuff and nonsense all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper place.</p>
